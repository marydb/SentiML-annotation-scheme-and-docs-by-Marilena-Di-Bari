Please find here the annotation scheme described in "SentiML: functional annotation for multilingual sentiment analysis", 
Di Bari M. Sharoff S., Thomas M., DHcase2013, Florence (Italy), 2013.

The scheme is aimed at fine-grained sentiment analysis informed by the Appraisal Framework (Martin & White, 2005) part of 
the Systemic Funtional Linguistics.

The scheme consists of a DTD, which is meant to be used with the annotation software Mae (Stubbs 2011).

In addition both the original files in .txt format, and the annotated ones in .xml format are provided. These are divided 
in folders for each language, i.e. English, Italian and Russian.

If you use any of the component for your research, please give me credit by citing my work and, of course, let me know :) 
Also, comments and suggestions are welcome.
